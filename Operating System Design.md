# Operating System Development Roadmap

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive roadmap for building a functional operating system from the ground up.

This roadmap serves as a practical guide for developers. It details the progression through each layer of OS creation, from initial CPU activation to the execution of custom shell commands.

---

## Purpose of this Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to facilitate:
1.  Systematic OS construction, from fundamental components to higher-level functionalities.
2.  Identification of essential learning objectives and their optimal sequence.
3.  A deep understanding of CPU operational modes, memory management, and execution flows.
4.  Trackable progress through defined milestones, ensuring continuous development.

## Roadmap Structure

Each phase within this document is organized into three distinct sections:

| Label        | Description                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal** | The specific outcome to be achieved by the completion of the phase. |
| **Learn** | Fundamental concepts and tools required for the phase.       |
| **Build** | Practical components or code implementations to be developed. |

Each phase contributes directly to the construction of a real operating system component.

# Core Operating System Design Principles

## Defining an Operating System

A system qualifies as a genuine Operating System when it incorporates the following core components:

| Component               | Description                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bootloader** | Responsible for loading the kernel from disk into memory.   |
| **Kernel** | Manages CPU resources, memory, and hardware interactions.   |
| **Interrupt Handling** | Controls the communication mechanism between hardware and the CPU. |
| **Memory Management** | Handles the proper allocation and deallocation of Random Access Memory (RAM). |
| **System Calls (Syscalls)** | Provides an interface for user programs to interact with the kernel. |
| **Program Execution** | Enables the loading and execution of external user applications. |
| **Filesystem** (optional initially) | Facilitates reading from and writing to files.        |
| **Shell** | Offers a user interface (Command Line Interface/Graphical User Interface) for system interaction. |

A basic operating system has been built if it can:
-   Boot from custom code.
-   Load a kernel.
-   Execute programs.
-   Manage fundamental hardware interactions (e.g., keyboard, display).
-   Provide a user interaction interface (Shell).

---

## Shell vs. Operating System

**Conclusion:** A Shell is not an Operating System.

**Explanation:**
-   A Shell is a user interface that communicates with the kernel.
-   Commands issued through the Shell are translated into **system calls**.
-   The kernel performs the actual operations, including process creation, memory allocation, and hardware access.

### Clarification on Common Misconceptions

Confusion often arises because:
-   The Shell is the primary component users directly interact with.
-   In certain embedded or experimental systems, a Shell might operate directly on hardware without an explicit kernel, leading to the impression that it functions as the entire OS.

| Scenario                            | Full OS Designation |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Shell operating on a Linux kernel   | Yes                 |
| Shell operating directly on hardware | Potentially         |
| Shell without kernel or process management | No                  |

---

## Execution Order: Kernel vs. Bootloader

The **Bootloader** always executes first.

-   Upon power-on, the CPU initiates execution from a predetermined memory address.
-   This initial code is typically located in Read-Only Memory (ROM) or within the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS).
-   The Bootloader's function is to load the kernel into memory and then transfer execution control to it.

> The Bootloader precedes and enables the kernel's execution.

---

## Shell Development Pre-Full OS

A Shell can be developed prior to a complete Operating System. However, it will function as a user interface prototype unless it is integrated with:
-   Robust process management.
-   System call support.
-   Memory and execution management.

Developing a Shell independently serves as a valuable learning phase before full OS development.

---

## Filesystem Requirement

A filesystem is not a mandatory component in the initial stages of OS development. However, it becomes necessary for loading external programs or persistent file storage.

---

## Assembly Language Necessity

Assembly language is generally required for OS development due to its role in:
-   Bootloader implementation.
-   Transitioning to Protected Mode.
-   Low-level hardware configuration.

---

## Linux: Kernel or OS?

Linux refers specifically to the **kernel**. A complete operating system distribution, such as Ubuntu, comprises the Linux kernel combined with GNU tools and a shell environment.

---

## Kernel Mode vs. User Mode

| Mode        | Access Permissions                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Kernel Mode | Full access to hardware and memory resources. |
| User Mode   | Restricted access, relying on system calls for OS services. |
